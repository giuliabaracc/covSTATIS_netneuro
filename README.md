# Reproducible example for the paper "covSTATIS: a multi-table technique for network neuroscience"

This repository contains reproducible code and a tutorial for our paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14481. Note that after we posted the preprint, we moved things around. The tutorial is no longer in `/Code` (as that folder no longer exists). Please refer to our website for tutorial + all info on code. 

Here, you will find the data used in the tutorial `/Data`, all the information showed on the website including the tutorial itself `/pages/tutorial.qmd`.
Happy covSTATISing :)

This website provides the tutorial with reproducible example for our manuscript "covSTATIS: a multi-table technique for network neuroscience". 

In this repo, you'll find data (/Data) and code (/pages/tutorial.qmd) we used to create our covSTATIS tutorial. All info on how to run the tutorial yourself is in the .qmd file (or as .rmd file) :)

Happy covSTATISing :)
